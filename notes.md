# TODOs and Notes

## TODO
* setup discord slash command to start / stop recording, and specify which channel to join
* setup concatenating transcriptions
    * concatenate by timestamp with users name included
* setup summarization after concatenation
* post summary back to channel

### Ideas / maybes
* Create a thread in the channel and post the transcript as it happens live?
    * might be too noisy?
